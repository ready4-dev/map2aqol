Description: Tools for mapping measures routinely collected in
    youth mental health services to AQOL 6D Health Utility. Part of the
    First Bounce model of primary youth mental health services.  This
    development version of the youthu package has been made available as
    part of the process of testing and documenting the package. The tools
    contained in this development release are based on placeholder models
    estimated from synthetic data and are for demonstration purposes only
    and they should not yet be used to inform policy decisions. If you
    have any questions, please contact the authors
    (matthew.hamilton@orygen.org.au).  The documentation for this package
    has been automatically generated by the ready4fun package and is
    therefore quite rudimentary. Human authored documentation will follow
    in 2021.
