Description: Tools for mapping measures routinely collected in youth
    mental health services to AQOL 6D Health Utility. Part of the First
    Bounce model of primary youth mental health services.  This
    development version of the youthu package has been made available as
    part of the process of testing and documenting the package. The tools
    contained in this development release are designed for use in
    conjunction with model objects stored in data repositories. The real
    model objects will be publicly released once the associated scientific
    manuscript is published. In the mean time, we have included links to
    placeholder model objects derived from synthetic data.  For this
    reason, this release is for demonstration purposes only and this
    package should not yet be used in analyses deigned to inform policy
    decisions. If you have any questions, please contact the authors
    (matthew.hamilton@orygen.org.au).  The documentation for this package
    has been automatically generated by the ready4fun package and is
    therefore quite rudimentary. Human authored documentation will follow
    in 2021.
