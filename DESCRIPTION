Description: Tools for mapping measures routinely collected in youth
    mental health services to Quality Adjusted Life Years (QALYs). Part of
    the First Bounce model of primary youth mental health services.  This
    development version of the youthu package has been made available as
    part of the process of testing and documenting the package. If you
    have any questions, please contact the authors
    (matthew.hamilton@orygen.org.au).  The documentation for this package
    has been automatically generated by the ready4fun package and is
    therefore quite rudimentary. Further human authored documentation will
    follow in 2021.
