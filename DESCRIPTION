Description: Tools for mapping measures routinely collected in
    youth mental health services to AQOL 6D Health Utility. Part of the
    First Bounce model of primary youth mental health services.  This
    development version of the map2aqol package has been made available as
    part of the process of testing and documenting the package. The tools
    contained in this development release automate a number of tasks which
    MODIFY THE DIRECTORY STRUCTURE OF YOUR LOCAL MACHINE.  Therefore you
    should only trial this software if you feel confident that you
    understand what it does and have created a sandpit area in which you
    can safely undertake testing. If you have any questions, please
    contact the authors (matthew.hamilton@orygen.org.au).  The
    documentation for this package has been automatically generated by the
    ready4fun package and is therefore quite rudimentary. Human authored
    documentation will follow in 2021.
